# 🎯 About Me:
💻 I’m a final year Integrated B.Tech (IT) student at IIIT Gwalior with a strong foundation in backend development, systems design, and scalable architecture.

🧠 I've completed multiple software development internships where I built and optimized backend services, designed RESTful APIs, and worked on real-world system architectures.

⚙️ I'm also exploring DevOps workflows — containerization, CI/CD, and cloud-native tools — to better understand how large systems operate in production.

🚀 Seeking to contribute to backend or DevOps teams solving real-world scalability and reliability challenges through clean architecture and efficient system design.
