# 🎯 About Me:
💻 I’m a final year Integrated B.Tech (IT) student at IIIT Gwalior with a strong foundation in backend development and a deep curiosity about how systems work — from understanding and designing them to coding scalable solutions.

🧠 Through internships and projects, I’ve built robust backend services, integrated cloud and payment systems, and worked on optimizing real-world architectures.

⚙️  I’m curious about DevOps and cloud workflows — exploring Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes, and AWS services — to understand how reliable systems are deployed and scaled in production.

🚀 I'm seeking to contribute to backend or platform teams solving real-world performance and reliability challenges.
